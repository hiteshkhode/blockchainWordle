# BLOCKCHAIN WORDLE
## _What is a blockchain wordle?_
 The immensely popular game of "Wordle" is a centralized application owned and operated by NY Times. What if the servers are hacked and someone changes the correct word just to win the game? Now, the application serves as a test bed to demonstrate the security due to blockchain decentralized services, now a days, very much in talks due to it's virtues.

#### I highly recommend 3Blue1Brown's video to get the intuition behind blockchain's way of setting wheels into motion.

## This is "how to" for setting up application on your local machine.

### _(make sure you have node and npm installed on your machine)_

- Clone the repository into your machine.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hiteshkhode/blockchainWordle.git
```
- There are two applications and therefore two directories namely
> wordle_blockchain
> generation_word

- The more detailed documentation on "how to" of the setup of generation_word is given in it clone https://github.com/hiteshkhode/word_generation.git

- Now change directory and enter wordle_blockchain and install the required dependencies. This is the client side of the application.
```sh
cd wordle_blockchain
npm i
```

- The site will go live on port 3000.

##### _HAVE A NICE ONE._
